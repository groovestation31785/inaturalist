### Purpose
iNaturalist API Project:

1. Display data from iNaturalist API in a single page application. 
2. Demonstrate understanding of practices around building Sinatra applications.
3. Show creativity with presenting information that changes in size with every API call. 

### Quickstart

1.  `bundle install`
2. Â `bundle exec shotgun config.ru`

### To be continued

This simple web application was developed with the span of 48 hours. I was not able to accomplish all the features that I would have wanted. Here is a list of ice box items that I would like to hash out to continue the learning experience:

1. JavaScript - as of right now, I have no original JavaScript in the project. Bootstrap makes front end features simple. I did not need to do too much when it came to creating the tabs. It would have been a better learning experience for me to create the tabs myself. 
2. I would learn how to properly test the API calls with Rack Test. In theory, I know how it would work; however actually implementing it correctly is a different story. 
3. Add simplecov gem to detect my test coverage. The app is simple, but I would still like to track the parts of code that need tests. I know I would overlook areas that need coverage. 
4. Reactor! I know this is not the driest piece of code out there. I'd look over everything and decide if it's written with the best practices in mind. I'd do more research to determine what type of adjustments I should make.
